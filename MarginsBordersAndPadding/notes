THESE NOTES ARE FOR MY OWN REFERENCE ONLY

Remember that the things we worked on were from glitch.com and codepen.io.
The files will be missing the `html` element among other things

- Remember to look into flexbox for vertically aligning things. It's VERY useful!

An example of it is as follows:
```
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  text-align: center;
```
